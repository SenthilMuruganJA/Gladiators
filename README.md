# Gladiators




problem statement 1

            Determining the soil pH value using image-processing.First step is to import the captured image and perform histogram operation.This operation give us the RGB Value seperately.There via formula we can get the pH value of obtained soil image.Then it compared with the available dataset of us.The highest compared value is the pH value of the soil which is in the image.


problem statement 2
          
           This idea is to manage the crowd.Here we used MATLAB for for detecting number of people.If it reaches the extent,then it should follow the wayfinding Optimization,Queue Management,Temporary Closures.


problem statement 3


          This statement is used to detect the length and breath of the people's shirt or kurthi.This takes an algorithm of distance of camera from the man and according to it ,the length varies.Then it takes the certain point on the body and measures and display the size of the shirt accordingly.
